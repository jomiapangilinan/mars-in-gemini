<p class="text-to-life">25th of May 2017
I was sitting on the floor, legs sprawled, with scattered memories skirted around me
Couldn’t help thinking; where do I begin to tell my story?
Is it a dance or a song? A montage of images or drawn?
As I sat back, it dawned on me what I had not seen
Snapshots of beautiful people who had given a part of me

Defining the limbo of compromise and dreams, it felt like the dialogues were speaking directly to me
At this point of my life where I am trapped in the limbo of where I am and where I wanted to be
A flash of epiphany went up in my head, I realized it shouldn’t really be a concept
Because the only thing I need for this debut to be, is to surround myself with my family
The airports had always remind me of better days, thanks to Papa
He first left for an engineering contract somewhere in the Middle East
I was young as could be, so no hard feelings for me

Every couple of years he would leave the gates of the same airport
With chocolates and a promise of going places 
My five year old version would think this is where I would like to be
Heralding structures that serve as bridges and pathways from here to foreign lands
Expressed in the words of, “Ma gusto ko rin sumama sa loob at sumakay sa erpleyn!!”

When Mom got too strict with her teaching of multiplication table
I ran back to you, tears in my face, and the multiplication table lesson 
Became an art class, with you as my teacher and the airplanes as the subject
I could only count in my hands the times you were the one who tutored me
From shortcuts of multiplying four digit numbers to OFW: their stories and struggles
And every year in school, I’d proudly write your name in the space after Father
And tell all my friends, “My Papa is a Civil Engineer!”

Relatives and friends of the family would approach me saying, “Kamukha mo Papa mo oh!”
I know they were thinking I have your eyes, your lips, and your skin tone
But I was thinking I have your driven goal-oriented mindset and your meticulousness
I was thinking you showed your daughter raised with letters and spelling and words 
the delights of Math and saw its significance for my path

It was difficult to feign affection once you saw we were growing up, without Mom on our side
But your home-cooked delicious meals were like no other 
as well as your unwavering support on our decisions and leisure
You didn’t help me stand on my one year old feet, you waited for me to fall so you could pull me up

Thank you, Papa. I love you magayon man ako parang kaw eh. HAHAHA

Little Catherine, later nicknamed Kat sprung from our lives two years after I
Had been the cutest ruffle of curls and up to this day no one could top her baby afro
We were inseparably so that I used to climb to her crib and sing one-year old Kat to sleep
It only lasted for days, I tore the crib’s weaving as it couldn’t hold our size

Fast forward and everything else had been a series of squabbles
From “You’re wearing my shirt!” to “Why is she enrolling in my school? I got here first!”
You said I understood you the most, and it’s a sweet sound to a girl
Lost in translation, wondering why her lyrics could never harmonize with the music
But our fights almost always leave me with a stroke of inspiration and recognition

You are self-conscious and beautiful and the cause of my headaches and my counsellor
You are the last episode of a TV show’s season that I will never close my screen for
You don’t have to worry about your future, around you are people who truly cares
And yet you keep shutting the door, to what extent, to whose expense?

Kat, Catherine, Erin, Homie, Beb, Kulot, Katialis, 10q. 

Mom was probably the only one who lets me sleep in,
When I was five she would even make us chocolates in infant bottles 
But mark my words, seeing my sister and I fight and she throttles 
The best of us, wringing out the worst and believing in us so

You have always been my number one supporter,
So much so that you push me through almost every school event and talent show possible
From my first Champion award in a Kindergarten spelling bee to 
Hannah Montana’s singing competition to three Wowowee episodes
You were the first person to see that I could look at the world differently

Every morning I miss your voice singing along to ABBA and Rachel Ann Go
Your dance moves that never falter, asking us to join your Zumba sessions
Your unwavering determination to look for humor in tense situations
And your ease in befriending strangers and warm communication

Thank you for seeing my future even before I did
For being my constant supply of oxygen when I was born 
without breathing normally and when I had months of pneumonia
For being my lifesaver when I had been diagnosed of dengue twice

Looking at your old photos, your features remind me of royalty
With posture that cheated its way out of life knocking it down
Kind, compelling eyes that always sees a way out of every trouble
And hands that has kept us healthy from vulnerability

I had read in a book that a child of a Roman warrior goddess and a mortal 
Had been blessed with the ability to lend her strength during hurdles
She was your counterpart or you were hers, and she was Reyna as well
Thank you for heralding a throne not most can hold without giving up


Mama Lyn’s home is filled with childhood stories with foundations of perseverance
She was blessed with humility and loyalty, making her everyone’s go-to person
From Sorsogon to Quezon City to Cainta to Manila, she has been tested by God in ways more than one
Even then she has the potential and passion to knowledge – what with teaching and learning – 
and she connects well with everyone, even if she says otherwise

She connects best with Tita Ghie, health aficionado and wild funny butterfly from Quezon
It was no surprise that Mama Lyn’s endless generosity would pay off when her
home would be filled with three, when Dave came to be

There were more beautiful characters in this story, every homebody Mom entrusted us to
As well as Lola Puring whose cooking and guidance I terribly miss, Lola Qube, 
Ate Kim and our playdates, Ate Eunice and Shy and the inflatable pool in our backyard we used to dive into thinking it was the ocean, as well as our Bicol travelogues 
Kuya Louis and Kuya Noel’s tutoring classes, which 
reminds me of every child Mom has nurtured and tutored 
And then there is Ate Daisy with her wits, storytelling gift, and four beautiful kids
Mamay, now finally a US citizen, who had brought me to life,
Who had used to braid my hair while I’m still groggy, and tickle me to death 
Tita Elsie, who without a second thought took us in when we were lost and standing in the middle of crossroads and held our hands while crossing the street,
with her patience and diligence for education and for what is just
Lola Ditty with her amazing collection of books and interesting stories that never end
And the teachers I have grown fond of and looked upon as my other mothers

I have always been a fan of homes for there are beauty in houses that was built from anecdotes
Especially the ones built from ashes and community, as my relatives’ houses in Pampanga is
Tito Glenn, Tito Manny, Tita Lilia, Tito Dict, Tito Philip and their excellence in creating a home out of unpainted bricks and the fallen, their ambitions fulfilled and their family happy
And each one of my cousins who had completed my childhood and made every delicious meal even better with laughter, activities, and company
Who had also shown me the value of getting aboard a rough journey and finishing it at your own pace

Thank you for raising me with every emotion there is, thank you for being constant.

There are friends, and then there are you guys. 

With our sleepovers and made-up clubs real enough to fund our pencil dreams
Who evidently never stopped being her creative self, 
and to whom I have to give credit to for being one of the first to believe in my writing ventures,
because if you never spent sixth grade with me in the library brainstorming books 
and trading pens with Anaklusmos, I would never get to fall in love with words 

for all the tests, academically, emotionally, and existentially,
For handing me every color possible and letting me paint on every canvas 

So that we could prove to ourselves that we wouldn’t give up on second chances
We are all in the limbo of our age, but that doesn’t stop us from hoping beyond
Thank you for showing me that there is no half-hearted love, it is chaos and serenity
Late night conversations, rushing back and forth, rediscovering art as you walk home
Madness and spontaneity, bringing back magic from dreams and our upbringing

I ruffled through pictures and dug beneath papers
Trying to remember what I had lost and discovered

As I sat back, it dawned on me what I had not seen
Snapshots of beautiful people who had given a part of me

You know what? A long time ago, I would’ve enumerated a long list of every cause, of every issue of human and earthly suffering. But I’ve learned that there are so many people fighting for the same things. One noble purpose, united by one similarity: it is rooted to them personally.
I am a Filipina. And I had been conditioned to believe that to succeed, I must excel at all of my pursuits. Pursuits worth taking. But I cannot give my all to fight for everything.
I am a Filipina. I fight for what it means to be a Filipina. I fight so that Filipinx/a/o can unlearn our colonial mentalities and fight for what they personally believe in. 	
Quite possibly, I am also in my worst mental health state to date. Struggling with the after/current math of a pandemic, with exacerbated symptoms. But here I am, like many of us are, awake in the middle of the night. Unsatisfied and striving to be better versions of ourselves. So we can go out there, join the protests, and do our part in dismantling gcolonial systems.
I stand/sit here, my existence a radical revolution. 
To inspire women to forge their own paths. I assure you, to be a Filipina, it is a battle worth fighting for.

I started writing this essay at 12:40 midnight today. I honestly didn’t know how or where to begin. This is a topic close to my heart – I have mulled this on long subway rides, at night before I go to sleep, before meeting new people, in making new decisions, in the pursuit of serving the Filipino Canadian community. I was told to share my family reunification or separation story, but that is not the story that keeps me going. It’s my mom. 
The way you felt tonight is how you should feel for your entire life.

The boy drunken in the best night of his life, who continued longing for the girl who didn't leave him, but for herself, a summary.

The allure of a life rightly lived...that's not me.

We can never love a free spirit. It was never something to be owned. We gather up the dusts and throw it away, looking for a treasure buried beneath. Somewhere, waiting
to be found. Except free spirits never needed to be tied down. They may stay for a while, as long as they soaked up the life of the vessel in sheer pursuit of mutualism.
The free spirit takes up one's experience, talent, wisdom, art and share what it may in return. And then when it has all it needs to be, it refuses the surrounding arms
that once embraced them. Too soon, the embrace will feel like choking. And then they will fly away, with only themselves as companions. Sometimes it isn't enough, 
loneliness is an evolutionary need that must be filled. But free spirits function on their own, and the loneliness will go away eventually. 

Free spirits also possess narcissism and discontentment. I would say perfectionism but even that would be an argument waiting to be triggered. They don't believe in the
concept of perfectionism, what had been perfect once will become disarrayed, flawed, broken, insufficient, or tragically reminiscing. They will look for something more. 
Always hungry for more. Because adventure will never cease tempting them, what should be or what shouldn't be. There will always be stereotypes and norms to argue and then some
bandwagons to fuss about. Sometimes, they even go so far as to refuse that what is a routine can be recognized as art. That humanity and adventure is present everywhere,
if you only begin to notice. See beyond the ordinary. Admire the relentless pursuit of human over triumph, even if the process gets painstakingly the same. Look inside
every person and every ritual. Find the art inside every unique combination of DNA and marvel the random creations in this vast mindnumbing universe.
I shifted to Computer Science without having any comprehensive background knowledge on the course, zero percent tech skills, but with a hundred percent curiosity on the triumph of human civilization. What I've always wanted to do is to play with the psycho biology of humanity while inspiring with my visual art and music and writing skills. I already have skills on the aforementioned and I could always do them in my spare time, so the pragmatic thing to do is to learn new ones that would benefit my passion in the future. The closest thing I have to a concrete vision for a career is to find and build the correlation of computer science to the neurobiology and psychology of human beings. Sometimes our thoughts seem to be jumbled and chaotic but what if they are only layers and layers or connecting points upon connecting points that strayed too far from our original thought? This is where my thought mapping program or invention comes into view. In a world of confusion, I dream sometimes my idea will bloom to clear our chaotic minds to finally make way for compassion.

Do you honestly think it's worth it to lose the friendship that we've had over some scumbag's 
immature way of handling personal insecurities????

What makes you think she won't gossip about you as well?

MARIA CLARA: A POSTMODERN WOMAN ni Carlo Ebarda

Domesticated. Defenseless. Objectified.

I was used as a metaphor for mockery and earthly desires of a chauvinistic society. I was clothed with ideals I detested. 
I followed the set norms of a macho society and became the stereotypical woman fit for the eyes of both men and capitalists. 
I was not allowed to disagree simply because I was a woman. The very same society to which I gave birth to subjugated me. 
I was silenced and was made to simply oblige.

I was every battered wife. Mine was the face of a woman crying out for help. I was every abandoned daughter. Mine was the face of the longing and the lost. Mine was the face of the poor. I was portrayed the vulnerable, the forgotten, and the defenseless.

Nonetheless, I refuse to believe that such is the way my story must unfold. I beg to differ to these norms and societal expectations. These are not my realities; for I am much more than these. I do not want you to look at me with pity. 
These same vulnerabilities have empowered me towards my own liberation, not just as a woman but as a human being. 
While history has been a silent witness to my eternal clamor for an egalitarian society, justice taught me rational resistance. 
I asserted my rights and the rights of my bloodline. 
I took part in a revolution. 
I engaged in a diplomatic dialogue. 
I choose not yield to the ephemeral social blindness 
that wants to silence my voice.

I refuse to adhere to a society that limits my social function as a woman to my reproductive potential. 
I taught myself to read, to write, to be critical, 
to question, and to argue.

And so, beneath the rubbles of my social subjugation, 
I asserted the beauty of my soul. 
I fought colonizers and dictators. 
I was both a homemaker and a revolutionary. 
Yes, I could do both; yes, I could do more. 
I was a meek Oriang to a valiant Andres Bonifacio. 
I was a fierce Gabriela to a brave Diego Silang. 
I was Remedios Paraiso-Gomez; I fought the war with charm and valor. 
I was Lorena Barros; I fought an abusive regime. 
I was the brave Liliosa Hilao during the Martial Law.

I took my advocacy to the streets and to the halls of the judiciary. I asserted my voice in the political arena. 
I established civic organizations. I am a teacher, a doctor, a lawyer, a soldier, a scientist, an engineer, an architect, a peace advocate, and a warrior for the environment.

I am empowered, political, and free.

My meekness allows no oppression. 
My amiability permits no offense. 
My docility gives no way for social injustice. 
My voice echoes not only within the confines of a home that has been my subtle prison for so long.

You and I, our birthright necessitates equal and inviolable human dignity. 
Let us allow each other then, a sense of liberation to enjoy these social privileges that come with our diverse humanity.

This is neither pride nor overt feminism. This is simply my truth; my embraced womanhood; my humanity. 
This is my story. 
I am Maria Clara and I am a postmodern woman
=============
1. You have 30 seconds to convince me otherwise.
2. Are you having a bad day?
3. I don't care what everyone else says. I don't think you're that bad.
4. You know, if I were to jump from your ego to your IQ, I'd probably break both my legs.
5. On a scale of 1 to 10, how old are you
6. What makes you so special?
7.  
8. I'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.

Trying to remember what I had lost and discovered
Love, for Gemini risings, is often expressed through mediation. They feel loved when someone is willing to take a moment to reside in their perspective even when engaging in their perspective triggers emotions of shame and judgment in the other person. A lot of Gemini risings are taught to be mediators of the different groups of people who they can take with. Love that feels like a relief comes when someone allows them to put away their mediator hat by doing the work of understanding them. This understanding work necessitates the putting away of egos.

A lot of the times, imagined community does not feel peaceful or innately healing for Gemini risings. The concept of community is complicated. Aries in the eleventh house is a Mars ruled eleventh house and Gemini risings might have related to the communities that they grew up in from a place of alienation or conflict. Gemini risings are aware that community is not an universal term and that some communities are prioritized over others.

Gemini risings, often, find that their creativity shows up when they express it through other people. Gemini risings need creative community and to see the values that they respond to enacted through the people around them. They need to know that people are willing to understand across differences while sharing their struggles.

Always hungry for more. Because adventure will never cease tempting them, what should be or what shouldn't be. There will always be stereotypes and norms to argue and then some
bandwagons to fuss about. Sometimes, they even go so far as to refuse that what is a routine can be recognized as art. That humanity and adventure is present everywhere,
if you only begin to notice. See beyond the ordinary. Admire the relentless pursuit of human over triumph, even if the process gets painstakingly the same. Look inside
every person and every ritual. Find the art inside every unique combination of DNA and marvel the random creations in this vast mindnumbing universe.
I shifted to Computer Science without having any comprehensive background knowledge on the course, zero percent tech skills, but with a hundred percent curiosity on the triumph of human civilization. What I've always wanted to do is to play with the psycho biology of humanity while inspiring with my visual art and music and writing skills. I already have skills on the aforementioned and I could always do them in my spare time, so the pragmatic thing to do is to learn new ones that would benefit my passion in the future. The closest thing I have to a concrete vision for a career is to find and build the correlation of computer science to the neurobiology and psychology of human beings. Sometimes our thoughts seem to be jumbled and chaotic but what if they are only layers and layers or connecting points upon connecting points that strayed too far from our original thought? This is where my thought mapping program or invention comes into view. In a world of confusion, I dream sometimes my idea will bloom to clear our chaotic minds to finally make way for compassion.

MARIA CLARA: A POSTMODERN WOMAN ni Carlo Ebarda

Domesticated. Defenseless. Objectified.

I was used as a metaphor for mockery and earthly desires of a chauvinistic society. I was clothed with ideals I detested. 
I followed the set norms of a macho society and became the stereotypical woman fit for the eyes of both men and capitalists. 
I was not allowed to disagree simply because I was a woman. The very same society to which I gave birth to subjugated me. 
I was silenced and was made to simply oblige.

I was every battered wife. Mine was the face of a woman crying out for help. I was every abandoned daughter. Mine was the face of the longing and the lost. Mine was the face of the poor. I was portrayed the vulnerable, the forgotten, and the defenseless.

Nonetheless, I refuse to believe that such is the way my story must unfold. I beg to differ to these norms and societal expectations. These are not my realities; for I am much more than these. I do not want you to look at me with pity. 
These same vulnerabilities have empowered me towards my own liberation, not just as a woman but as a human being. 
While history has been a silent witness to my eternal clamor for an egalitarian society, justice taught me rational resistance. 
I asserted my rights and the rights of my bloodline. 
I took part in a revolution. 
I engaged in a diplomatic dialogue. 
I choose not yield to the ephemeral social blindness 
that wants to silence my voice.

I refuse to adhere to a society that limits my social function as a woman to my reproductive potential. 
I taught myself to read, to write, to be critical, 
to question, and to argue.

And so, beneath the rubbles of my social subjugation, 
I asserted the beauty of my soul. 
I fought colonizers and dictators. 
I was both a homemaker and a revolutionary. 
Yes, I could do both; yes, I could do more. 
I was a meek Oriang to a valiant Andres Bonifacio. 
I was a fierce Gabriela to a brave Diego Silang. 
I was Remedios Paraiso-Gomez; I fought the war with charm and valor. 
I was Lorena Barros; I fought an abusive regime. 
I was the brave Liliosa Hilao during the Martial Law.

I took my advocacy to the streets and to the halls of the judiciary. I asserted my voice in the political arena. 
I established civic organizations. I am a teacher, a doctor, a lawyer, a soldier, a scientist, an engineer, an architect, a peace advocate, and a warrior for the environment.

I am empowered, political, and free.

My meekness allows no oppression. 
My amiability permits no offense. 
My docility gives no way for social injustice. 
My voice echoes not only within the confines of a home that has been my subtle prison for so long.

You and I, our birthright necessitates equal and inviolable human dignity. 
Let us allow each other then, a sense of liberation to enjoy these social privileges that come with our diverse humanity.

This is neither pride nor overt feminism. This is simply my truth; my embraced womanhood; my humanity. 
This is my story. 
I am Maria Clara and I am a postmodern woman

1. You have 30 seconds to convince me otherwise.
2. Are you having a bad day?
3. I don't care what everyone else says. I don't think you're that bad.
4. You know, if I were to jump from your ego to your IQ, I'd probably break both my legs.
5. On a scale of 1 to 10, how old are you
6. What makes you so special?

8. I'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.

Love, for Gemini risings, is often expressed through mediation. They feel loved when someone is willing to take a moment to reside in their perspective even when engaging in their perspective triggers emotions of shame and judgment in the other person. A lot of Gemini risings are taught to be mediators of the different groups of people who they can take with. Love that feels like a relief comes when someone allows them to put away their mediator hat by doing the work of understanding them. This understanding work necessitates the putting away of egos.

A lot of the times, imagined community does not feel peaceful or innately healing for Gemini risings. The concept of community is complicated. Aries in the eleventh house is a Mars ruled eleventh house and Gemini risings might have related to the communities that they grew up in from a place of alienation or conflict. Gemini risings are aware that community is not an universal term and that some communities are prioritized over others.

Gemini risings, often, find that their creativity shows up when they express it through other people. Gemini risings need creative community and to see the values that they respond to enacted through the people around them. They need to know that people are willing to understand across differences while sharing their struggles.

25th of May 2017
I was sitting on the floor, legs sprawled, with scattered memories skirted around me
Couldn’t help thinking; where do I begin to tell my story?
Is it a dance or a song? A montage of images or drawn?
As I sat back, it dawned on me what I had not seen
Snapshots of beautiful people who had given a part of me

Defining the limbo of compromise and dreams, it felt like the dialogues were speaking directly to me
At this point of my life where I am trapped in the limbo of where I am and where I wanted to be
A flash of epiphany went up in my head, I realized it shouldn’t really be a concept
Because the only thing I need for this debut to be, is to surround myself with my family
The airports had always remind me of better days, thanks to Papa
He first left for an engineering contract somewhere in the Middle East
I was young as could be, so no hard feelings for me

Every couple of years he would leave the gates of the same airport
With chocolates and a promise of going places 
My five year old version would think this is where I would like to be
Heralding structures that serve as bridges and pathways from here to foreign lands
Expressed in the words of, “Ma gusto ko rin sumama sa loob at sumakay sa erpleyn!!”

When Mom got too strict with her teaching of multiplication table
I ran back to you, tears in my face, and the multiplication table lesson 
Became an art class, with you as my teacher and the airplanes as the subject
I could only count in my hands the times you were the one who tutored me
From shortcuts of multiplying four digit numbers to OFW: their stories and struggles
And every year in school, I’d proudly write your name in the space after Father
And tell all my friends, “My Papa is a Civil Engineer!”

Relatives and friends of the family would approach me saying, “Kamukha mo Papa mo oh!”
I know they were thinking I have your eyes, your lips, and your skin tone
But I was thinking I have your driven goal-oriented mindset and your meticulousness
I was thinking you showed your daughter raised with letters and spelling and words 
the delights of Math and saw its significance for my path

It was difficult to feign affection once you saw we were growing up, without Mom on our side
But your home-cooked delicious meals were like no other 
as well as your unwavering support on our decisions and leisure
You didn’t help me stand on my one year old feet, you waited for me to fall so you could pull me up

Thank you, Papa. I love you magayon man ako parang kaw eh. HAHAHA

Little Catherine, later nicknamed Kat sprung from our lives two years after I
Had been the cutest ruffle of curls and up to this day no one could top her baby afro
We were inseparably so that I used to climb to her crib and sing one-year old Kat to sleep
It only lasted for days, I tore the crib’s weaving as it couldn’t hold our size

Fast forward and everything else had been a series of squabbles
From “You’re wearing my shirt!” to “Why is she enrolling in my school? I got here first!”
You said I understood you the most, and it’s a sweet sound to a girl
Lost in translation, wondering why her lyrics could never harmonize with the music
But our fights almost always leave me with a stroke of inspiration and recognition

You are self-conscious and beautiful and the cause of my headaches and my counsellor
You are the last episode of a TV show’s season that I will never close my screen for
You don’t have to worry about your future, around you are people who truly cares
And yet you keep shutting the door, to what extent, to whose expense?

Kat, Catherine, Erin, Homie, Beb, Kulot, Katialis, 10q. 

Mom was probably the only one who lets me sleep in,
When I was five she would even make us chocolates in infant bottles 
But mark my words, seeing my sister and I fight and she throttles 
The best of us, wringing out the worst and believing in us so

You have always been my number one supporter,
So much so that you push me through almost every school event and talent show possible
From my first Champion award in a Kindergarten spelling bee to 
Hannah Montana’s singing competition to three Wowowee episodes
You were the first person to see that I could look at the world differently

Every morning I miss your voice singing along to ABBA and Rachel Ann Go
Your dance moves that never falter, asking us to join your Zumba sessions
Your unwavering determination to look for humor in tense situations
And your ease in befriending strangers and warm communication

Thank you for seeing my future even before I did
For being my constant supply of oxygen when I was born 
without breathing normally and when I had months of pneumonia
For being my lifesaver when I had been diagnosed of dengue twice

Looking at your old photos, your features remind me of royalty
With posture that cheated its way out of life knocking it down
Kind, compelling eyes that always sees a way out of every trouble
And hands that has kept us healthy from vulnerability

I had read in a book that a child of a Roman warrior goddess and a mortal 
Had been blessed with the ability to lend her strength during hurdles
She was your counterpart or you were hers, and she was Reyna as well
Thank you for heralding a throne not most can hold without giving up


Mama Lyn’s home is filled with childhood stories with foundations of perseverance
She was blessed with humility and loyalty, making her everyone’s go-to person
From Sorsogon to Quezon City to Cainta to Manila, she has been tested by God in ways more than one
Even then she has the potential and passion to knowledge – what with teaching and learning – 
and she connects well with everyone, even if she says otherwise

She connects best with Tita Ghie, health aficionado and wild funny butterfly from Quezon
It was no surprise that Mama Lyn’s endless generosity would pay off when her
home would be filled with three, when Dave came to be

There were more beautiful characters in this story, every homebody Mom entrusted us to
As well as Lola Puring whose cooking and guidance I terribly miss, Lola Qube, 
Ate Kim and our playdates, Ate Eunice and Shy and the inflatable pool in our backyard we used to dive into thinking it was the ocean, as well as our Bicol travelogues 
Kuya Louis and Kuya Noel’s tutoring classes, which 
reminds me of every child Mom has nurtured and tutored 
And then there is Ate Daisy with her wits, storytelling gift, and four beautiful kids
Mamay, now finally a US citizen, who had brought me to life,
Who had used to braid my hair while I’m still groggy, and tickle me to death 
Tita Elsie, who without a second thought took us in when we were lost and standing in the middle of crossroads and held our hands while crossing the street,
with her patience and diligence for education and for what is just
Lola Ditty with her amazing collection of books and interesting stories that never end
And the teachers I have grown fond of and looked upon as my other mothers

I have always been a fan of homes for there are beauty in houses that was built from anecdotes
Especially the ones built from ashes and community, as my relatives’ houses in Pampanga is
Tito Glenn, Tito Manny, Tita Lilia, Tito Dict, Tito Philip and their excellence in creating a home out of unpainted bricks and the fallen, their ambitions fulfilled and their family happy
And each one of my cousins who had completed my childhood and made every delicious meal even better with laughter, activities, and company
Who had also shown me the value of getting aboard a rough journey and finishing it at your own pace

Thank you for raising me with every emotion there is, thank you for being constant.

There are friends, and then there are you guys. 

With our sleepovers and made-up clubs real enough to fund our pencil dreams
Who evidently never stopped being her creative self, 
and to whom I have to give credit to for being one of the first to believe in my writing ventures,
because if you never spent sixth grade with me in the library brainstorming books 
and trading pens with Anaklusmos, I would never get to fall in love with words 

for all the tests, academically, emotionally, and existentially,
For handing me every color possible and letting me paint on every canvas 

So that we could prove to ourselves that we wouldn’t give up on second chances
We are all in the limbo of our age, but that doesn’t stop us from hoping beyond
Thank you for showing me that there is no half-hearted love, it is chaos and serenity
Late night conversations, rushing back and forth, rediscovering art as you walk home
Madness and spontaneity, bringing back magic from dreams and our upbringing

I ruffled through pictures and dug beneath papers
Trying to remember what I had lost and discovered

As I sat back, it dawned on me what I had not seen
Snapshots of beautiful people who had given a part of me

You know what? A long time ago, I would’ve enumerated a long list of every cause, of every issue of human and earthly suffering. But I’ve learned that there are so many people fighting for the same things. One noble purpose, united by one similarity: it is rooted to them personally.
I am a Filipina. And I had been conditioned to believe that to succeed, I must excel at all of my pursuits. Pursuits worth taking. But I cannot give my all to fight for everything.
I am a Filipina. I fight for what it means to be a Filipina. I fight so that Filipinx/a/o can unlearn our colonial mentalities and fight for what they personally believe in. 	
Quite possibly, I am also in my worst mental health state to date. Struggling with the after/current math of a pandemic, with exacerbated symptoms. But here I am, like many of us are, awake in the middle of the night. Unsatisfied and striving to be better versions of ourselves. So we can go out there, join the protests, and do our part in dismantling gcolonial systems.
I stand/sit here, my existence a radical revolution. 
To inspire women to forge their own paths. I assure you, to be a Filipina, it is a battle worth fighting for.

I started writing this essay at 12:40 midnight today. I honestly didn’t know how or where to begin. This is a topic close to my heart – I have mulled this on long subway rides, at night before I go to sleep, before meeting new people, in making new decisions, in the pursuit of serving the Filipino Canadian community. I was told to share my family reunification or separation story, but that is not the story that keeps me going. It’s my mom. 
The way you felt tonight is how you should feel for your entire life.

The boy drunken in the best night of his life, who continued longing for the girl who didn't leave him, but for herself, a summary.

The allure of a life rightly lived...that's not me.

We can never love a free spirit. It was never something to be owned. We gather up the dusts and throw it away, looking for a treasure buried beneath. Somewhere, waiting
to be found. Except free spirits never needed to be tied down. They may stay for a while, as long as they soaked up the life of the vessel in sheer pursuit of mutualism.
The free spirit takes up one's experience, talent, wisdom, art and share what it may in return. And then when it has all it needs to be, it refuses the surrounding arms
that once embraced them. Too soon, the embrace will feel like choking. And then they will fly away, with only themselves as companions. Sometimes it isn't enough, 
loneliness is an evolutionary need that must be filled. But free spirits function on their own, and the loneliness will go away eventually. 

Free spirits also possess narcissism and discontentment. I would say perfectionism but even that would be an argument waiting to be triggered. They don't believe in the
concept of perfectionism, what had been perfect once will become disarrayed, flawed, broken, insufficient, or tragically reminiscing. They will look for something more. 
Always hungry for more. Because adventure will never cease tempting them, what should be or what shouldn't be. There will always be stereotypes and norms to argue and then some
bandwagons to fuss about. Sometimes, they even go so far as to refuse that what is a routine can be recognized as art. That humanity and adventure is present everywhere,
if you only begin to notice. See beyond the ordinary. Admire the relentless pursuit of human over triumph, even if the process gets painstakingly the same. Look inside

I was sitting on the floor, legs sprawled, with scattered memories skirted around me
Couldn’t help thinking; where do I begin to tell my story?
Is it a dance or a song? A montage of images or drawn?
As I sat back, it dawned on me what I had not seen
Snapshots of beautiful people who had given a part of me

Defining the limbo of compromise and dreams, it felt like the dialogues were speaking directly to me
At this point of my life where I am trapped in the limbo of where I am and where I wanted to be
A flash of epiphany went up in my head, I realized it shouldn’t really be a concept

Heralding structures that serve as bridges and pathways from here to foreign lands
Expressed in the words of, “Ma gusto ko rin sumama sa loob at sumakay sa erpleyn!!”

When Mom got too strict with her teaching of multiplication table
I ran back to you, tears in my face, and the multiplication table lesson 
Became an art class, with you as my teacher and the airplanes as the subject
I could only count in my hands the times you were the one who tutored me
From shortcuts of multiplying four digit numbers to OFW: their stories and struggles
And every year in school, I’d proudly write your name in the space after Father
And tell all my friends, “My Papa is a Civil Engineer!”

Relatives and friends of the family would approach me saying, “Kamukha mo Papa mo oh!”
I know they were thinking I have your eyes, your lips, and your skin tone
But I was thinking I have your driven goal-oriented mindset and your meticulousness
I was thinking you showed your daughter raised with letters and spelling and words 
the delights of Math and saw its significance for my path

It was difficult to feign affection once you saw we were growing up, without Mom on our side
But your home-cooked delicious meals were like no other 
as well as your unwavering support on our decisions and leisure
You didn’t help me stand on my one year old feet, you waited for me to fall so you could pull me up

Thank you, Papa. I love you magayon man ako parang kaw eh. HAHAHA

Little Catherine, later nicknamed Kat sprung from our lives two years after I
Had been the cutest ruffle of curls and up to this day no one could top her baby afro
We were inseparably so that I used to climb to her crib and sing one-year old Kat to sleep
It only lasted for days, I tore the crib’s weaving as it couldn’t hold our size

Fast forward and everything else had been a series of squabbles
From “You’re wearing my shirt!” to “Why is she enrolling in my school? I got here first!”
You said I understood you the most, and it’s a sweet sound to a girl
Lost in translation, wondering why her lyrics could never harmonize with the music
But our fights almost always leave me with a stroke of inspiration and recognition

You are self-conscious and beautiful and the cause of my headaches and my counsellor
You are the last episode of a TV show’s season that I will never close my screen for
You don’t have to worry about your future, around you are people who truly cares
And yet you keep shutting the door, to what extent, to whose expense?

Kat, Catherine, Erin, Homie, Beb, Kulot, Katialis, 10q. 

Mom was probably the only one who lets me sleep in,
When I was five she would even make us chocolates in infant bottles 
But mark my words, seeing my sister and I fight and she throttles 
The best of us, wringing out the worst and believing in us so

You have always been my number one supporter,
So much so that you push me through almost every school event and talent show possible
From my first Champion award in a Kindergarten spelling bee to 
Hannah Montana’s singing competition to three Wowowee episodes
You were the first person to see that I could look at the world differently

Every morning I miss your voice singing along to ABBA and Rachel Ann Go
Your dance moves that never falter, asking us to join your Zumba sessions
Your unwavering determination to look for humor in tense situations
And your ease in befriending strangers and warm communication

Thank you for seeing my future even before I did
For being my constant supply of oxygen when I was born 
without breathing normally and when I had months of pneumonia
For being my lifesaver when I had been diagnosed of dengue twice

Looking at your old photos, your features remind me of royalty
With posture that cheated its way out of life knocking it down
Kind, compelling eyes that always sees a way out of every trouble
And hands that has kept us healthy from vulnerability

I had read in a book that a child of a Roman warrior goddess and a mortal 
Had been blessed with the ability to lend her strength during hurdles
She was your counterpart or you were hers, and she was Reyna as well
Thank you for heralding a throne not most can hold without giving up


Mama Lyn’s home is filled with childhood stories with foundations of perseverance
She was blessed with humility and loyalty, making her everyone’s go-to person
From Sorsogon to Quezon City to Cainta to Manila, she has been tested by God in ways more than one
Even then she has the potential and passion to knowledge – what with teaching and learning – 
and she connects well with everyone, even if she says otherwise

She connects best with Tita Ghie, health aficionado and wild funny butterfly from Quezon
It was no surprise that Mama Lyn’s endless generosity would pay off when her
home would be filled with three, when Dave came to be

There were more beautiful characters in this story, every homebody Mom entrusted us to
As well as Lola Puring whose cooking and guidance I terribly miss, Lola Qube, 
Ate Kim and our playdates, Ate Eunice and Shy and the inflatable pool in our backyard we used to dive into thinking it was the ocean, as well as our Bicol travelogues 
Kuya Louis and Kuya Noel’s tutoring classes, which 
reminds me of every child Mom has nurtured and tutored 
And then there is Ate Daisy with her wits, storytelling gift, and four beautiful kids
Mamay, now finally a US citizen, who had brought me to life,
Who had used to braid my hair while I’m still groggy, and tickle me to death 
Tita Elsie, who without a second thought took us in when we were lost and standing in the middle of crossroads and held our hands while crossing the street,
with her patience and diligence for education and for what is just
Lola Ditty with her amazing collection of books and interesting stories that never end
And the teachers I have grown fond of and looked upon as my other mothers

I have always been a fan of homes for there are beauty in houses that was built from anecdotes
Especially the ones built from ashes and community, as my relatives’ houses in Pampanga is
Tito Glenn, Tito Manny, Tita Lilia, Tito Dict, Tito Philip and their excellence in creating a home out of unpainted bricks and the fallen, their ambitions fulfilled and their family happy
And each one of my cousins who had completed my childhood and made every delicious meal even better with laughter, activities, and company
Who had also shown me the value of getting aboard a rough journey and finishing it at your own pace

Thank you for raising me with every emotion there is, thank you for being constant.

There are friends, and then there are you guys. 

With our sleepovers and made-up clubs real enough to fund our pencil dreams
Who evidently never stopped being her creative self, 
and to whom I have to give credit to for being one of the first to believe in my writing ventures,
because if you never spent sixth grade with me in the library brainstorming books 
and trading pens with Anaklusmos, I would never get to fall in love with words 

for all the tests, academically, emotionally, and existentially,
For handing me every color possible and letting me paint on every canvas 

So that we could prove to ourselves that we wouldn’t give up on second chances
We are all in the limbo of our age, but that doesn’t stop us from hoping beyond
Thank you for showing me that there is no half-hearted love, it is chaos and serenity
Late night conversations, rushing back and forth, rediscovering art as you walk home
Madness and spontaneity, bringing back magic from dreams and our upbringing

I ruffled through pictures and dug beneath papers
Trying to remember what I had lost and discovered

As I sat back, it dawned on me what I had not seen
Snapshots of beautiful people who had given a part of me

You know what? A long time ago, I would’ve enumerated a long list of every cause, of every issue of human and earthly suffering. But I’ve learned that there are so many people fighting for the same things. One noble purpose, united by one similarity: it is rooted to them personally.
I am a Filipina. And I had been conditioned to believe that to succeed, I must excel at all of my pursuits. Pursuits worth taking. But I cannot give my all to fight for everything.
I am a Filipina. I fight for what it means to be a Filipina. I fight so that Filipinx/a/o can unlearn our colonial mentalities and fight for what they personally believe in. 	
Quite possibly, I am also in my worst mental health state to date. Struggling with the after/current math of a pandemic, with exacerbated symptoms. But here I am, like many of us are, awake in the middle of the night. Unsatisfied and striving to be better versions of ourselves. So we can go out there, join the protests, and do our part in dismantling gcolonial systems.
I stand/sit here, my existence a radical revolution. 
To inspire women to forge their own paths. I assure you, to be a Filipina, it is a battle worth fighting for.

I started writing this essay at 12:40 midnight today. I honestly didn’t know how or where to begin. This is a topic close to my heart – I have mulled this on long subway rides, at night before I go to sleep, before meeting new people, in making new decisions, in the pursuit of serving the Filipino Canadian community. I was told to share my family reunification or separation story, but that is not the story that keeps me going. It’s my mom. 
The way you felt tonight is how you should feel for your entire life.

The boy drunken in the best night of his life, who continued longing for the girl who didn't leave him, but for herself, a summary.

The allure of a life rightly lived...that's not me.

We can never love a free spirit. It was never something to be owned. We gather up the dusts and throw it away, looking for a treasure buried beneath. Somewhere, waiting
to be found. Except free spirits never needed to be tied down. They may stay for a while, as long as they soaked up the life of the vessel in sheer pursuit of mutualism.
The free spirit takes up one's experience, talent, wisdom, art and share what it may in return. And then when it has all it needs to be, it refuses the surrounding arms
that once embraced them. Too soon, the embrace will feel like choking. And then they will fly away, with only themselves as companions. Sometimes it isn't enough, 
loneliness is an evolutionary need that must be filled. But free spirits function on their own, and the loneliness will go away eventually. 

Free spirits also possess narcissism and discontentment. I would say perfectionism but even that would be an argument waiting to be triggered. They don't believe in the
concept of perfectionism, what had been perfect once will become disarrayed, flawed, broken, insufficient, or tragically reminiscing. They will look for something more. 
Always hungry for more. Because adventure will never cease tempting them, what should be or what shouldn't be. There will always be stereotypes and norms to argue and then some
bandwagons to fuss about. Sometimes, they even go so far as to refuse that what is a routine can be recognized as art. That humanity and adventure is present everywhere,
if you only begin to notice. See beyond the ordinary. Admire the relentless pursuit of human over triumph, even if the process gets painstakingly the same. Look inside
every person and every ritual. Find the art inside every unique combination of DNA and marvel the random creations in this vast mindnumbing universe.
I shifted to Computer Science without having any comprehensive background knowledge on the course, zero percent tech skills, but with a hundred percent curiosity on the triumph of human civilization. What I've always wanted to do is to play with the psycho biology of humanity while inspiring with my visual art and music and writing skills. I already have skills on the aforementioned and I could always do them in my spare time, so the pragmatic thing to do is to learn new ones that would benefit my passion in the future. The closest thing I have to a concrete vision for a career is to find and build the correlation of computer science to the neurobiology and psychology of human beings. Sometimes our thoughts seem to be jumbled and chaotic but what if they are only layers and layers or connecting points upon connecting points that strayed too far from our original thought? This is where my thought mapping program or invention comes into view. In a world of confusion, I dream sometimes my idea will bloom to clear our chaotic minds to finally make way for compassion.

MARIA CLARA: A POSTMODERN WOMAN ni Carlo Ebarda

Domesticated. Defenseless. Objectified.

I was used as a metaphor for mockery and earthly desires of a chauvinistic society. I was clothed with ideals I detested. 
I followed the set norms of a macho society and became the stereotypical woman fit for the eyes of both men and capitalists. 
I was not allowed to disagree simply because I was a woman. The very same society to which I gave birth to subjugated me. 
I was silenced and was made to simply oblige.

I was every battered wife. Mine was the face of a woman crying out for help. I was every abandoned daughter. Mine was the face of the longing and the lost. Mine was the face of the poor. I was portrayed the vulnerable, the forgotten, and the defenseless.

Nonetheless, I refuse to believe that such is the way my story must unfold. I beg to differ to these norms and societal expectations. These are not my realities; for I am much more than these. I do not want you to look at me with pity. 
These same vulnerabilities have empowered me towards my own liberation, not just as a woman but as a human being. 
While history has been a silent witness to my eternal clamor for an egalitarian society, justice taught me rational resistance. 
I asserted my rights and the rights of my bloodline. 
I took part in a revolution. 
I engaged in a diplomatic dialogue. 
I choose not yield to the ephemeral social blindness 
that wants to silence my voice.

I refuse to adhere to a society that limits my social function as a woman to my reproductive potential. 
I taught myself to read, to write, to be critical, 
to question, and to argue.

And so, beneath the rubbles of my social subjugation, 
I asserted the beauty of my soul. 
I fought colonizers and dictators. 
I was both a homemaker and a revolutionary. 
Yes, I could do both; yes, I could do more. 
I was a meek Oriang to a valiant Andres Bonifacio. 
I was a fierce Gabriela to a brave Diego Silang. 
I was Remedios Paraiso-Gomez; I fought the war with charm and valor. 
I was Lorena Barros; I fought an abusive regime. 
I was the brave Liliosa Hilao during the Martial Law.

I took my advocacy to the streets and to the halls of the judiciary. I asserted my voice in the political arena. 
I established civic organizations. I am a teacher, a doctor, a lawyer, a soldier, a scientist, an engineer, an architect, a peace advocate, and a warrior for the environment.

I am empowered, political, and free.

My meekness allows no oppression. 
My amiability permits no offense. 
My docility gives no way for social injustice. 
My voice echoes not only within the confines of a home that has been my subtle prison for so long.

You and I, our birthright necessitates equal and inviolable human dignity. 
Let us allow each other then, a sense of liberation to enjoy these social privileges that come with our diverse humanity.

This is neither pride nor overt feminism. This is simply my truth; my embraced womanhood; my humanity. 
This is my story. 
I am Maria Clara and I am a postmodern woman
=============
1. You have 30 seconds to convince me otherwise.
2. Are you having a bad day?
3. I don't care what everyone else says. I don't think you're that bad.
4. You know, if I were to jump from your ego to your IQ, I'd probably break both my legs.
5. On a scale of 1 to 10, how old are you
6. What makes you so special?
7.  
8. I'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.

Trying to remember what I had lost and discovered
Love, for Gemini risings, is often expressed through mediation. They feel loved when someone is willing to take a moment to reside in their perspective even when engaging in their perspective triggers emotions of shame and judgment in the other person. A lot of Gemini risings are taught to be mediators of the different groups of people who they can take with. Love that feels like a relief comes when someone allows them to put away their mediator hat by doing the work of understanding them. This understanding work necessitates the putting away of egos.

A lot of the times, imagined community does not feel peaceful or innately healing for Gemini risings. The concept of community is complicated. Aries in the eleventh house is a Mars ruled eleventh house and Gemini risings might have related to the communities that they grew up in from a place of alienation or conflict. Gemini risings are aware that community is not an universal term and that some communities are prioritized over others.

Gemini risings, often, find that their creativity shows up when they express it through other people. Gemini risings need creative community and to see the values that they respond to enacted through the people around them. They need to know that people are willing to understand across differences while sharing their struggles.

25th of May 2017
I was sitting on the floor, legs sprawled, with scattered memories skirted around me
Couldn’t help thinking; where do I begin to tell my story?
Is it a dance or a song? A montage of images or drawn?
As I sat back, it dawned on me what I had not seen
Snapshots of beautiful people who had given a part of me

Defining the limbo of compromise and dreams, it felt like the dialogues were speaking directly to me
At this point of my life where I am trapped in the limbo of where I am and where I wanted to be
A flash of epiphany went up in my head, I realized it shouldn’t really be a concept
Because the only thing I need for this debut to be, is to surround myself with my family
The airports had always remind me of better days, thanks to Papa
He first left for an engineering contract somewhere in the Middle East
I was young as could be, so no hard feelings for me

Every couple of years he would leave the gates of the same airport
With chocolates and a promise of going places 
My five year old version would think this is where I would like to be
Heralding structures that serve as bridges and pathways from here to foreign lands
Expressed in the words of, “Ma gusto ko rin sumama sa loob at sumakay sa erpleyn!!”

When Mom got too strict with her teaching of multiplication table
I ran back to you, tears in my face, and the multiplication table lesson

The closest thing I have to a concrete vision for a career is to find and build the correlation of computer science to the neurobiology and psychology of human beings. Sometimes our thoughts seem to be jumbled and chaotic but what if they are only layers and layers or connecting points upon connecting points that strayed too far from our original thought? This is where my thought mapping program or invention comes into view. In a world of confusion, I dream sometimes my idea will bloom to clear our chaotic minds to finally make way for compassion.

Do you honestly think it's worth it to lose the friendship that we've had over some scumbag's 
immature way of handling personal insecurities????

MARIA CLARA: A POSTMODERN WOMAN ni Carlo Ebarda

Domesticated. Defenseless. Objectified.

I was used as a metaphor for mockery and earthly desires of a chauvinistic society. I was clothed with ideals I detested. 
I followed the set norms of a macho society and became the stereotypical woman fit for the eyes of both men and capitalists. 
I was not allowed to disagree simply because I was a woman. The very same society to which I gave birth to subjugated me. 
I was silenced and was made to simply oblige.

I was every battered wife. Mine was the face of a woman crying out for help. I was every abandoned daughter. Mine was the face of the longing and the lost. Mine was the face of the poor. I was portrayed the vulnerable, the forgotten, and the defenseless.

Nonetheless, I refuse to believe that such is the way my story must unfold. I beg to differ to these norms and societal expectations. These are not my realities; for I am much more than these. I do not want you to look at me with pity. 
These same vulnerabilities have empowered me towards my own liberation, not just as a woman but as a human being. 
While history has been a silent witness to my eternal clamor for an egalitarian society, justice taught me rational resistance. 
I asserted my rights and the rights of my bloodline. 
I took part in a revolution. 
I engaged in a diplomatic dialogue. 
I choose not yield to the ephemeral social blindness 
that wants to silence my voice.

I refuse to adhere to a society that limits my social function as a woman to my reproductive potential. 
I taught myself to read, to write, to be critical, 
to question, and to argue.

And so, beneath the rubbles of my social subjugation, 
I asserted the beauty of my soul. 
I fought colonizers and dictators. 
I was both a homemaker and a revolutionary. 
Yes, I could do both; yes, I could do more. 
I was a meek Oriang to a valiant Andres Bonifacio. 
I was a fierce Gabriela to a brave Diego Silang. 
I was Remedios Paraiso-Gomez; I fought the war with charm and valor. 
I was Lorena Barros; I fought an abusive regime. 
I was the brave Liliosa Hilao during the Martial Law.

I took my advocacy to the streets and to the halls of the judiciary. I asserted my voice in the political arena. 
I established civic organizations. I am a teacher, a doctor, a lawyer, a soldier, a scientist, an engineer, an architect, a peace advocate, and a warrior for the environment.

I am empowered, political, and free.

My meekness allows no oppression. 
My amiability permits no offense. 
My docility gives no way for social injustice. 
My voice echoes not only within the confines of a home that has been my subtle prison for so long.

You and I, our birthright necessitates equal and inviolable human dignity. 
Let us allow each other then, a sense of liberation to enjoy these social privileges that come with our diverse humanity.

This is neither pride nor overt feminism. This is simply my truth; my embraced womanhood; my humanity. 
This is my story. 
I am Maria Clara and I am a postmodern woman

1. You have 30 seconds to convince me otherwise.
2. Are you having a bad day?
3. I don't care what everyone else says. I don't think you're that bad.
4. You know, if I were to jump from your ego to your IQ, I'd probably break both my legs.
5. On a scale of 1 to 10, how old are you
6. What makes you so special?
7.  
8. I'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.
I ruffled through pictures and dug beneath papers
Trying to remember what I had lost and discovered

Love, for Gemini risings, is often expressed through mediation. They feel loved when someone is willing to take a moment to reside in their perspective even when engaging in their perspective triggers emotions of shame and judgment in the other person. A lot of Gemini risings are taught to be mediators of the different groups of people who they can take with. Love that feels like a relief comes when someone allows them to put away their mediator hat by doing the work of understanding them. This understanding work necessitates the putting away of egos.

A lot of the times, imagined community does not feel peaceful or innately healing for Gemini risings. The concept of community is complicated. Aries in the eleventh house is a Mars ruled eleventh house and Gemini risings might have related to the communities that they grew up in from a place of alienation or conflict. Gemini risings are aware that community is not an universal term and that some communities are prioritized over others.

Gemini risings, often, find that their creativity shows up when they express it through other people. Gemini risings need creative community and to see the values that they respond to enacted through the people around them. They need to know that people are willing to understand across differences while sharing their struggles.

Gemini risings need creative community and to see the values that they respond to enacted through the people around them. They need to know that people are willing to understand across differences while sharing their struggles.
Gemini risings can be a little tricky with their Pisces midheavens. They are capable of seeming like completely different people in different surroundings. Part of their survival strategy is about adopting different mannerisms, voices, or vocabularies based on who they are around and how they feel they need to be seen by. Pisces is the sign that Venus becomes exalted or visible through and Gemini risings can feel like they are meant to mean something different to everyone and anyone.

With Virgo in the fourth house, Gemini risings come into the many worlds that they inhabit from a foundation of critique. They may be moving from a bourgeois art gallery to a basement anarchist talk all in one night but they’re critiquing both settings in their own heads in private. Just because Gemini risings are able to go into any setting and blend in doesn’t mean that they do so in a complacent way. They go into their worlds ready to fire a snarky comment or two.

The Virgo and Pisces axis is about subtleties. Gemini risings notice and reframe the subtle ways in which banal reality asserts itself. They know that hidden assumptions are not didactic but mundane and they know that power asserts itself in mundane ways. Gemini risings notice all the things that most people don’t notice and they are always ready to argue back.
