# Mars in Gemini

![Snapshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60398789/111012680-d946cd00-836a-11eb-866f-1a7fe662fdc8.png)

**Mars in Gemini ♊** is a mini web development x art snickerdoodle depicting the wayward Mercurial bundle of Gemini energy and creativity. Created out of a collage of my old writings + beloved words—both that had transcended time & space ✨⠀

*aka this is me and my inner child playing around with language x motion art*⠀

---

This transit, paired with the springing of March & the slow-burn ending of brooding winter prompts the discomfort of needing to look inward while needing to put energy *somewhere*

💌 So here's a March (2021) prompt for you:⠀
- How do I recognize the energy that recognizes itself? 
- What do I include in the ecosystem I am cultivating, in silence, of peace, under the rainbow?⠀
⠀
🧿🧿🧿
